#Java Learning Labs: CIS 162

This repository is a collection of small JAVA programs that I wrote when learning how to program in JAVA. They cover topics like strings, array lists, GUIs, and more. All projects were written in BlueJ originally, although they could probably be imported into any other IDE as well.

##Bank Account

This program functions as a simple bank account and supports deposits, balance queries, and simple interest.

##Phrase Decryptor

This program is used to translate an encrypted phrase from a string. Was used to learn about substrings.


##Array List Objects

This program reads in a list of line delimited students formatted like this: `fname,lname,id,gpa` and outputs several new lists including:

- Full class roster
- Highest GPA
- Probation List

##Pizza Order

Pizza Order is a graphical program that calculates the cost of a pizza as a user selects radio buttons and checkboxes for toppings, sizes, and styles.

##Car Payment Panel

Car Payment Panel was a program written to learn how to use Graphical User Interfaces to accept input from users. The user inputs the principle, interest, and amount of months on a car loan and the monthly cost is outputted to the user.

##String Generator

String Generator is a collection of small programs that manipulate strings and use algorithms to create output. Included is the ability to calculate the area of a triangle, the surface area of a randomly generated cylinder, and a username from a first and last name.

##Conversions

These programs were written when learning how main methods worked as well as how to accept input from the user. There are several simple conversion tools to convert between change and dollars, to seconds, and from seconds.
